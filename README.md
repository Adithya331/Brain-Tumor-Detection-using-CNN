# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-CNN
# Introduction :
### A brain tumor is regarded as one of the most competitive diseases among children and adults. The majority of number one Central Nervous System (CNS) malignancies are brain tumors, which account for 85 to 90% of all CNS tumors. Every year, around 11,700 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor. Humans with a malignant mind or CNS tumor have a 5-year survival rate of around 34 percent for men and 36 percent for women. There are three types of brain tumors: start tumor, middle tumor, and end tumor. Malignant Tumor, for example, requires proper treatment, planning, and diagnostics in order to improve the patients' life expectancy. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a great way to detect brain cancers (MRI). 
# Objective : 
### Our main objective is to detect a brain tumor from MRI (Magnetic Resonance Image) using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) .
###
### We developed a model which is able to detect a brain tumor from MRI using CNN , we used a brain MRI data founded on kaggle.
### - The Name of Datasets is 'Dataset Br35H'.
'Dataset Br35H' :   https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection
### - The Datasets contain two folder , one is 'yes' and another is 'no'.
### - The folder 'yes' contain MRI that is tumous and 'no' contain non-tumous.
### - We also  used another folder named 'pred' folder , which is used for prediction our model.
